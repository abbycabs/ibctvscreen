CLIC-Day-OICR
=============

A project we developed for our internal OICR hackathon (April 24-25, 2014). We got first place!

The main idea was to display screens on the kitchen TV that will inform OICR members about other OICR members and their works in the hope to build a stronger community.

Here are some screen ideas:
- bioinformatics person of the week
- github stats for open source projects
- tips of the week

The current iteration can be viewed at:

This project uses the framework reveal.js (https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
